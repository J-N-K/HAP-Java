/**
 * This characteristic describes the remaining duration on the accessory. Notifications on this
 * characteristic must only be used if the remaining duration increases/decreases from the
 * accessory ºs usual countdown of remaining duration and when the duration reaches 0. e.g. It must
 * not send notifications when the remaining duration is ticking down from 100,99,98... if 100 was
 * the initial Set duration. However, if the remaining duration changes to 95 from 92 (increase) or
 * 85 from 92 (decrease which is not part of the usual duration countdown), it must send a
 * notification. This duration is defined in seconds.
